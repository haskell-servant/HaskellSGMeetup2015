## The expression problem

> The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the
> datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing
> code, and while retaining static type safety (e.g., no casts).
>  __Philip Wadler, *The Expression Problem*, 1998__

* This is one of the things the combinator/classes design solves.
